# Introduction to Python masterclass
## Description
This repository contains material used in an introductory class for Python.  This includes walkthrough notebooks on the use of Python with example code, as well as challenges and worked example solutions.

## Accessing notebooks

**1) Downloading the notebooks to be opened in Jupyter**
From GitHub, you can download the repository containing the notebooks and use Jupyter notebook to open them and access the exercises they contain.  This requires Jupyter notebook to be installed on your computer, the link to which can be found here: [https://jupyter.org/]

**2)**
You can use Binder to open an interactive Jupyter notebook without installing anything.  Simply click this badge [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/stfcoz/PythonIntroduction/master) and launch in a new browser to create the Binder environment.  When Binder has finished building the environment, start the exercises by clicking "Intro.ipynb".

If the badge isn't working, you can set up the Binder environment manually by navigating to [https://mybinder.org/] and pasting the URL of the GitHub repository ([https://github.com/stfcoz/PythonIntroduction]) into the field "GitHub repository name or URL".  Click the "launch" button and wait for Binder to create the environment.
